# FirstRepository
This project was made to take an input file with a list of items and count them and also output a histogram of thye frequency of the items.
I think as complicated as the histogram could be it turned out as i had hoped, making it easy to compare items.
To improve my code i could make an out put file and add something to where it doesnt count the same file twice if you keep runnign the program.
Maps were challenging to write but i just kept studying them until i understood what each of the items in maps did.
Maps will be very useful in future projects as they are a very powerful tool.
To make the code more maintainable I added inline comments, and I tried to use coreect capitailization of functions and appropriate naming of variables to make it more
readable.
